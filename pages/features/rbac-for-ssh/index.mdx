videoDescription: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the practice of managing privileged access to infrastructure through a central directory of users, roles, and teams. Authorization is granted to groups (or roles) within a company directory. This allows individuals to access secured infrastructure by simply authenticating their identity, usually through a Single Sign-on (SSO) solution tied to the directory.
