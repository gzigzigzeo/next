## Hacker-Powered Security - Overview
### Key topics on Hacker-Powered Security
- Bug bounty programs and vuln disclosure programs are similar, except the first pays and the second doesn’t.
- The scope of bounty programs usually encompasses a company’s main application where the production sites are happening. What is out of scope is mostly third parties.
- Rules of engagement depend on the bug bounty program and the company.
- Some programs pay for credential stuffing, but not for phishing since companies don’t want you to phish their employees and customers.
- How much hackers are paid in a bug bounty program is entirely up to the company and depends on its budget.
- Determining the bug severity level depends on a combination of the vuln type and how critical it is and the asset itself.
- Hackers care more about how fast they get paid than about how quickly the company fixes the issue.
- A bug bounty program doesn’t make you a bigger target.
- Building a public bug bounty program depends on the product and size of the company.
- Improve Input validation to reduce bugs created

With over 685 vulnerabilities found in major sites such as Snapchat, Airbnb, and even the US Department of Defense, HackerOne helps companies by providing tools to help with response assessments and running their bug bounty programs. Hi, Ben. Thanks for joining us today.

**Ben S.**: Yeah, thank you for having me.

**Ben A.**: So to kick off, can you tell me about the first bug bounty that you found?

**Ben S.**: It’s been a very long time since I’ve been doing the bug bounty thing. But I want to say the first bug I found was back in late 2014, 2015. There wasn’t a lot of bug bounty programs, but it was a private program, I believe, on a bug bounty platform where they wanted us to just pretty much test their assets. And I was able to identify a self-XSS...
