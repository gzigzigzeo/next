- Challenges faces as VP of Security at npm were scale and availability — keeping the registry online so that you could get your packages.

## Offensive Security and the JavaScript Ecosystem - Introduction
**Ben**: Welcome to Access Control, a podcast providing practical security advice to start-ups, advice from people who’ve been there. Each episode we’ll interview a leader in that field and learn best practices and practical tips for securing your work. For today’s episode, I’ll be talking to Adam Baldwin, a.k.a. Evil Packet, Offensive Security, Auth0. Adam was previously VP of Security npm and founder of ^Lift Security, an application and pen testing company focused on the JavaScript ecosystem. Adam is a two-time DEFCON Black Badge holder. Hey, Adam, thanks for joining us today.

**Adam**: Thanks for having me, Ben.

**Ben**: To get started can you tell me how you got into the security industry.

**Adam**: Well, I’ll try to keep it short because it’s a relatively long story which started in my youth of course. I grew up in a small farming town in Minnesota with nothing to do and computers and ended up getting in trouble for getting into a local bulletin board system. That sort of sparked my curiosity, but also got me a mentor and really got my interest in security, reverse engineering programming, things like that..
