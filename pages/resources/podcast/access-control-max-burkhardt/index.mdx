## Securing Internal Applications - Overview
### Key topics on Securing Internal Applications
- In hyper growth companies, hyper growth itself is one of the key assets that need to be protected.
- It’s important not to draw too many lines between security roles in different subfields (securing engineering, data security, production security) since there are increasingly crossover points between infrastructure, security, and application security in the cloud age.
- There are differences in how B2B and B2C companies think about scale and about compliance.
- The desire to have nicely designed, effective internal web applications (such as a web UI to support various operations) is definitely growing. Figma decided to invest time in this area and built a really well-structured, effective approach early on.
- Some functionality works best as a command line tool, and in certain cases, it’s the right approach.
- Figma uses AWS for most of its cloud infrastructure, and uses Okta for employee authentication and authorization.
- Application load balancers (ALBs) are powerful reverse proxies that Amazon provides as a service, basically giving you an API to configure them.

## Securing Internal Applications - Introduction
**Ben**: Welcome to Access Control, a podcast providing practical security advice for startups. Advice from people who’ve been there. Each episode, we’ll interview a leader in their field and learn best practices and practical tips for securing your org. For today’s episode, I’ll be talking to [Max Burkhardt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxburkhardt/). I recently came across [Max’s work for the Figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/), in which Max used off-the-shelf AWS tech to secure a collection of internal web applications for Figma. After sharing the blog post internally, our IT director mentioned that he’d worked with Max previously at Airbnb and said Max would be a great addition to the podcast. Max is currently a security engineer at Figma. Hi, Max. Thanks for joining us today.

**Max**: Hi, there. A pleasure to be here.

**Ben**: So to kick it off, can you tell me a bit about your current and last role?

**Max**: Yeah. So I’m a security engineer at Figma. I tend to have a little bit of a focus on infrastructure security here, but being a security engineer at a small startup, everyone on the security team, there’s now five of us. We all wear a lot of hats and wherever the business’s need is greatest, we go there...
