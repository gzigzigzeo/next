videoDescription: Watch our demo of using Teleport Multi-Factor Authentication to access SSH
    and Kubernetes clusters. When setup users will be required to present a
    hardware token when trying to access resources. This greatly reduces the
    possibility of any malicious actor using Teleports key material to gain
    access to systems.
