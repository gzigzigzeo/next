**Dylan**: Hey, man. Great to be here.

**Ben**: To kick things off, can you tell me a little bit more about your background and the early days of software development in Santa Barbara?

**Dylan**: Yeah. Santa Barbara has kind of a rich history in software engineering and startups. It was kind of the original Silicon Beach actually, before I think, Santa Monica took that away from it at some point. But you got a lot of people coming out of UCSB that were in electrical engineering, material sciences and computer science. A lot of big research projects coming out of there and turning into startups...
