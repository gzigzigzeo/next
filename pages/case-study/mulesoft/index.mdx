Given the regulatory and compliance requirements in certain industries, many organizations cannot adopt a fully cloud approach. However, MuleSoft wanted to still deliver a SaaS-like experience to their customers even in on-premises environments. In addition, MuleSoft needed to reduce the operational burden of running Anypoint Platform across multiple customer deployments.

## Challenges

- Enable customers to simply install and use Anypoint Platform on-premises.
- Reduce operational burden of running multiple customer deployments.

Teleport first helped MuleSoft transition from its current development environment to using Kubernetes through an in-depth consulting and implementation services engagement. As part of that engagement, MuleSoft used Teleport technology so their developers could easily spin up and down Kubernetes development environments in order to increase development velocity. In addition, Teleport helped migrate Anypoint Platform to use Docker containers and Kubernetes container orchestration technologies.

Finally, Teleport packaged Anypoint Platform with a custom installer and Kubernetes so that Anypoint Platform could be easily installed and managed for their on-premises customers.

These product and service deliverables enable MuleSoft to deliver a new on-premises offering to their customer base in order to drive top line revenue, while limiting internal support and operational costs.

  and highly available instances of Anypoint Platform on their private infrastructure.

  to Kubernetes and trained MuleSoft developers in Kubernetes best practices.
