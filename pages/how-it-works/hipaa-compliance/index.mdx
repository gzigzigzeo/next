HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. Any company that deals with protected health information (PHI) must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. A critical component of HIPAA compliance is the implementation of Technical Safeguards set forth in § 164.312.

Teleport is a modern SSH access system that can help organizations comply with many of the Access and Audit requirements at the systems layer through its ability to integrate with existing identity management services and by providing role-based access controls (“RBAC”), access auditing, session recording and ephemeral certificates. Below is a summary of the Technical Safeguards outlined in HIPAA with information on how Teleport can help achieve compliance.

        ## (a) Standard: Access control.
        <p>
          Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow
          access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights as
          specified in § 164.308(a)(4).
        </p>          
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Teleport implements role based access control for remote terminals, which is the predominant way health care IT professionals 
          access computing infrastructure. This RBAC can be mapped to the administrative safeguards set up pursuant to §164.308.

    <tr>
      <td>
        ##### (i) Unique user identification.
        <p>
          Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity .
        </p>          
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Teleport integrates with existing identity providers and assigns access permissions based on enterprise single sign-on. Teleport’s  access auditing and tracking ties directly back to real user identity. 
        </p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ##### (ii) Emergency access procedure. 
        <p>
          Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.
        </p>          
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Remote terminals are often the last option available to access server infrastructure in an emergency (other than physically accessing servers). Teleport can make sure your permissions are enforced even during emergency SSH sessions. 
        </p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ##### (iii) Automatic logoff. 
        <p>
          Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.
        </p>          
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The Teleport Certificate Authority issues ephemeral certificates that expire after a pre-configured time period which eliminates the risk of unauthorized access through stale or compromised static access keys.
        </p>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ##### (iv) Encryption and decryption
        <p>
          Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information. 
        </p>          
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Teleport is based on encryption technology created by Google. Any session carried through Teleport automatically inherits high grade end-to-end transport encryption.
